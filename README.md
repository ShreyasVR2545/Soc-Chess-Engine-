General info
I have been playing chess since i was 10 and one day I had an idea to implement chess in Python. I was already in the process of trying to build an engine when this oppurtunity in SOC came up. The mentors were of great help but as i was already in the process of trying to do it from a youtuber named Eddie Sharick i continued with the same.
